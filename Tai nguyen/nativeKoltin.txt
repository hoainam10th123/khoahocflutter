Your app needs additional permissions and/or to be reinstalled.

Add additional permissions to AndroidManifest.xml within the <manifest> section:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
To reinstall, uninstall the app from the emulator or physical connected device and then run it again. (If adding permissions, make sure to reinstall afterwards.)
